# unsupervised-learning

## Intro/Objective
Used provided data to create an unsupervised machine learning model to locate clustering to further recommend studies on.

* Performed dimensionality reduction with PCA, preserved 90% of the explained variance
* Further reduced dataset dimensions with t-SNE and visually inspected the results with a scatter plot
* Cluster analysis performed with K-means to provide further recommendations.

## Technologies
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Source
* Previously provided file, which is saved in the Resources folder in the repo: "myopia.csv"

## Notes
* Brief notes and recommendations included in notebook
